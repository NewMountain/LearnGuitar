# LearnGuitar

This project comes from a person who loves programming as much as playing guitar. The inspiration
of the project is a tool to:

  1. Distract myself from all of the gear I seem to think I need (these days, a Strandberg)
  2. Help me learn a bit more about music theory
  3. Satisfy a desire to do more with Elm and explore parts of the language I might not use at work
  4. Ideally, make a tool that is helpful to myself and others

My general observation is all software used in helping to teach guitar seems to have stopped or stagnated years ago. I want this application to hopefully be a step in the right direction to improve
the state of guitar tools for practice. 

In the short term, this will focus on my own immediate needs, enabling me to systematically and methodically improve my playing in a deliberate and structured manner to become more comfortable in improvisation. 

To enable this, the application will allow a user to enter in a chord (short term goal) or chord progression (long term goal) and have the application suggest chords and scales to play. The practice routine will focus on playing the changes and making suggestions at a static speed, or gradually increasing speed.

## Please note

This project is a creative outlet and is purpose built for me. I would love to hear from you if you are interested in contributing or how you use this. If there is a feature you would like to see, I would invite the feedback, but make no promises on if and when I may implement such functionality. The goal of this, after all, is to enable me to practice guitar more.

### TODOs
-  [x] Create scales on demand
-  [x] Create arpeggios on demand
-  [ ] Add notion of fretboard
-  [ ] Allow 6 and 7 string guitars
-  [ ] Given a fretboard location, recomend chords and scales
-  [ ] Add in metronome
-  [ ] Add in notes (likely to involve JS)
-  [ ] Allow training mode to go incrementally faster over time


Rock on.
